# SA-Online-Mart
 
**This project is a prototype for the SA Online Mart web platform, making use of ASP.NET and using Entity Framework for database interaction.** 
 
 Users of the site can browse a list of items for sale, view product details, and add products to a shopping cart.

In order to edit product listings, create new listings, or delete items, a site admin must be registered and logged into the site. In the current implementation the site does not distinguish between any user and an admin other than being logged in, so any logged in user is considered an admin, and has CRUD access.
